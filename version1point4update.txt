Fixed in v1.4 (release ~4/15)
- Add daily cellular usage projection indicator
- Added German language
** for those who want different languages, you need to send me the translation file ***

In version 1.4, I have added a red indicator line that represents the target usage of the day. 
The calculation is based on usage in the beginning of the day + Total amount of data left / Total days left in cycle 
For example, as on today morning, I have used 1GB of my 2 GB data plan.
However, I have only 10 days remaining. Therefore, my target for today is 100MB
Indicator will show at 1.1GB.


Fixed in v1.3 (release ~2/24)
- Added new charting feature
- Daily cycle doesn't work after one day !!
- Cycle selection always shows 1st of month when tapped by default
- yellow color in the widget is making text unreadable
